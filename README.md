# Modeling-using-TensorFlow
1) Built a Linear Classifier model for predicting whether the passengers on titanic survived or not.
2) Built a Deep Neural Network Classifier model for predicting the species of flowers based on their features like 'SepalLength', 'SepalWidth', 'PetalLength', 'PetalWidth'.
3) Built a Hidden Markov model for predicting the temperature on each day taking help from the information provided.
